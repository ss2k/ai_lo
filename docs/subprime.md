Subprime Mortgage Underwriting Policy
=====================================

**Version:** 1.0 **Effective Date:** October 2, 2025 **Confidentiality:** For Internal Use Only

### **1.0 Definition and Purpose**

This document establishes the specific underwriting policy for mortgage loans extended to borrowers who do not meet the standard credit criteria for prime lending but may still demonstrate an acceptable ability to repay under stricter conditions.

A "subprime" borrower is generally defined by Acme Mortgage as an applicant possessing one or more of the following characteristics:

-   A representative credit score between **580 and 639**.

-   Significant derogatory credit events (e.g., bankruptcy, foreclosure) that fall within the seasoning periods required for prime loans.

The purpose of this subprime lending program is to provide limited, responsible credit to this market segment under highly controlled and risk-mitigated conditions. All subprime loans are considered portfolio products, underwritten with the intent to be held on Acme Mortgage's balance sheet and will not be sold on the secondary market. This policy is an addendum to the main "Comprehensive Mortgage Underwriting Policy Manual," and all sections of that manual apply unless superseded by the stricter standards herein.

### **2.0 Stricter Underwriting Standards**

All subprime loan applications are subject to heightened scrutiny and must adhere to the following conservative standards without exception. These standards supersede any less restrictive guidelines found in the primary underwriting manual.

-   **2.1 Minimum Credit Score:** The absolute minimum representative credit score permitted is **580**.

-   **2.2 Maximum Loan-to-Value (LTV) / Combined LTV (CLTV):** The maximum LTV and CLTV is **80%**. This necessitates a minimum 20% down payment or equity contribution, which must be sourced from the borrower's own verified funds. No gift funds are permitted for the down payment.

-   **2.3 Maximum Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio:** The maximum allowable back-end (total) DTI ratio is **41%**.

-   **2.4 Post-Closing Reserve Requirements:** A minimum of **6 months of PITI** (Principal, Interest, Taxes, and Insurance) in liquid, verified post-closing reserves is mandatory.

-   **2.5 Eligible Properties:** Lending is restricted to owner-occupied, single-family primary residences. Second homes, vacation properties, and investment properties are ineligible.

-   **2.6 Eligible Loan Products:** Only 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are permitted. All other loan types, including but not limited to Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs), interest-only loans, balloon mortgages, and loans with prepayment penalties, are strictly prohibited.

-   **2.7 Mandatory Escrow Account:** An escrow account for the collection and payment of property taxes and hazard insurance is mandatory for the life of the loan. Borrower-paid escrows (waivers) are not permitted.

-   **2.8 Derogatory Credit Event Seasoning:**

    -   **Bankruptcy:** A minimum of two years must have passed since the discharge date of any Chapter 7 or 11 bankruptcy.

    -   **Foreclosure/Short Sale:** A minimum of three years must have passed since the completion date of any foreclosure, short sale, or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.

    -   **Payment History:** The borrower's credit report must show no mortgage or rental payments more than 30 days late and no more than one non-mortgage payment 60+ days late within the most recent 12 months.

### **3.0 Approval Authority and Documentation**

-   **3.1 Underwriting Narrative:** Every subprime loan application requires a comprehensive underwriting narrative justifying the credit decision. The narrative must address the specific risks presented by the borrower's profile and detail the compensating factors that mitigate those risks. Strong compensating factors include, but are not limited to, an LTV significantly below 80%, reserves substantially exceeding the 6-month requirement, or a low DTI ratio.

-   **3.2 Dual Approval Requirement:** All final approvals for subprime loans require a second sign-off from a Senior Underwriter or the Chief Credit Officer. A single underwriter cannot issue a final approval for a subprime mortgage.
