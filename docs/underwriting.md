Comprehensive Mortgage Underwriting Policy Manual
=================================================

**Version:** 2.0 **Effective Date:** October 2, 2025 **Confidentiality:** For Internal Use Only

### **Part 1: Introduction and Foundational Principles**

#### **1.1 Preamble and Underwriter Responsibilities**

This Underwriting Policy Manual is the definitive guide for all mortgage underwriting, processing, and origination activities conducted by Acme Mortgage. It is designed to provide a consistent and structured framework for evaluating mortgage risk, ensuring all lending decisions are sound, prudent, and compliant with all applicable laws and regulations. The primary objective of this policy is to produce high-quality, investment-grade mortgage loans while promoting fair and equitable access to credit.

The role of the Underwriter is paramount. The underwriter is the primary guardian of asset quality, responsible for rendering an impartial and objective credit decision based on the documented facts of the loan file. Underwriters must exercise sound judgment, adhere strictly to this policy, and never subordinate risk analysis to business development or volume goals.

This manual is a living document and will be updated periodically to reflect changes in regulatory requirements, investor guidelines, and internal credit policy.

#### **1.2 The Underwriting Philosophy: The Four C's in Detail**

Our underwriting philosophy is built upon a foundation of risk mitigation, meticulous due diligence, and unwavering integrity. Every loan decision must be a balanced assessment of the borrower's willingness and ability to repay the debt, supported by sufficient collateral. The "Four C's" provide the framework for this analysis.

1.  **Credit (Willingness to Pay):** An evaluation of the borrower's history and demonstrated willingness to meet credit obligations. A thorough credit analysis is the primary indicator of future payment performance. This goes beyond a single score; it involves analyzing the entire credit profile for patterns of behavior, types of credit used, and response to financial hardship.

2.  **Capacity (Ability to Pay):** A quantitative assessment of the borrower's ability to manage the proposed mortgage payment in addition to their other financial obligations. This is determined through a rigorous analysis of stable, verifiable income, assets, and liabilities. The analysis must confirm that the income is likely to continue for at least the next three years.

3.  **Collateral (Security for the Loan):** An independent assessment of the value, condition, and marketability of the property securing the loan. The property must be adequate, marketable, and provide sufficient security for the mortgage debt throughout its life. The underwriter must be satisfied that the property is a sound investment at the loan amount requested.

4.  **Compliance (Adherence to Law):** An absolute adherence to the letter and spirit of all federal, state, and local lending laws. This is a non-negotiable component of every decision. No loan that fails to meet compliance standards will be approved, regardless of how strong the other factors may be.

#### **1.3 Regulatory and Legal Framework**

All underwriting activities must be conducted in strict compliance with all applicable regulations. This list is not exhaustive, and underwriters are responsible for staying current on all relevant lending laws.

-   **Ability-to-Repay/Qualified Mortgage Rule (ATR/QM):** Requires lenders to make a reasonable, good-faith determination that a consumer has the ability to repay a loan before it is consummated.

-   **Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA):** Prohibits discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction.

-   **Fair Housing Act (FHA):** Prohibits discrimination in all aspects of residential real estate-related transactions.

-   **Truth in Lending Act (TILA) / RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID):** Governs the disclosure of settlement costs and the timing of the loan closing.

-   **Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA):** Requires data collection and reporting on mortgage applications.

-   **Bank Secrecy Act / Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML):** Requires procedures to deter and detect financial fraud and money laundering.

-   **Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA):** Requires protection of consumers' non-public personal information.

-   **Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act (SAFE Act):** Requires licensing and registration for Mortgage Loan Originators.

### **Part 2: Borrower Analysis**

#### **2.1 Credit Analysis**

A comprehensive review of the borrower's credit history is mandatory.

-   **Credit Report:** A Tri-Merge Residential Mortgage Credit Report (RMCR) is required. The representative credit score is the middle of the three scores. For multiple borrowers, the single qualifying score will be the lowest of the borrowers' representative scores.

-   **Minimum Credit Score:** The minimum representative credit score is **640**. Scores from 640-679 are considered high risk and require additional compensating factors.

-   **Credit History Evaluation:**

    -   **Payment History:** A pattern of delinquent payments is a significant indicator of risk. Any 90+ day late payment within the last 24 months is grounds for automatic denial absent significant, documented extenuating circumstances (e.g., a documented medical emergency that is now resolved).

    -   **Collections & Judgments:** Medical collections may be excluded from DTI calculations. Non-medical collections and judgments must be paid in full prior to closing.

    -   **Significant Derogatory Events:**

        -   **Bankruptcy:** Chapter 7/11 must be discharged for a minimum of four years. Chapter 13 requires a minimum of two years from the discharge date or four years from the dismissal date.

        -   **Foreclosure:** A completed foreclosure must be seasoned for seven years.

        -   **Short Sale/Deed-in-Lieu:** Must be completed for four years.

    -   **Credit Inquiries:** A high number of recent inquiries (6+ in the last 6 months) requires a borrower-provided explanation to rule out undisclosed debt.

-   **Nontraditional Credit:** For borrowers with limited credit, a nontraditional credit history requires 12 months of verification from three sources, including verification of rent/housing, a utility, and one other source (e.g., insurance, tuition).

#### **2.2 Income & Employment Analysis (Capacity)**

All income must be stable, predictable, and likely to continue for at least three years.

-   **Employment Verification:**

    -   A two-year history of continuous employment is required. Gaps longer than 30 days require a letter of explanation.

    -   **Required Documentation:** W-2s (2 years), pay stubs (30 days), and a written/verbal VOE completed within 10 days of closing.

-   **Income Calculation:**

    -   **Salaried/Hourly:** Gross base pay is used.

    -   **Variable Income (Overtime, Bonus, Commission):** A 24-month history is required. A 24-month average will be calculated. The income must also be supported by a year-to-date (YTD) figure that is consistent with or greater than the historical average. Declining variable income is a significant risk factor.

    -   **Self-Employed:** Requires a rigorous analysis of the most recent two years of signed personal and business federal tax returns (all schedules). A cash flow analysis (Form 1084) must show stable or increasing revenue. Declining revenue requires a downgrade to a more conservative income calculation or denial. The business must be verified as active through a third-party source.

    -   **Other Income:** Rental income requires executed lease agreements and the most recent year of Schedule E tax returns. Alimony/child support requires a copy of the divorce decree/court order and 12 months' proof of receipt.

#### **2.3 Asset and Reserve Analysis**

Sufficient liquid assets must be verified for the down payment, closing costs, and required reserves.

-   **Documentation:** Two months of statements for all asset accounts (all pages). Any non-payroll deposit exceeding 25% of the borrower's qualifying monthly income must be sourced with a paper trail.

-   **Acceptable Sources:** Checking/savings, money market, stocks/bonds (valued at 70% of current market value), vested 401k/IRA funds (valued at 60% of vested balance, less any outstanding loan).

-   **Unacceptable Sources:** Cash on hand, unsecured loans, credit card advances, and funds from any party to the transaction (e.g., seller, real estate agent).

-   **Gift Funds:** Gifts are acceptable for primary residences from a direct family member. A gift letter stating the funds are not a loan, along with proof of transfer from the donor's account to the borrower's account, is required.

-   **Reserve Requirements:**

    -   **Primary Residence:** 2 months of PITI (Principal, Interest, Taxes, Insurance).

    -   **Second Home:** 4 months of PITI.

    -   **Investment Property:** 6 months of PITI for each financed property.

### **Part 3: Collateral Analysis**

#### **3.1 Appraisal Review**

-   **Independence:** All appraisals must be ordered via an approved AMC. Underwriters and loan officers may not communicate directly with the appraiser.

-   **Review Process:** The underwriter must review the entire appraisal report (URAR Form 1004).

    -   **Comparable Selection:** Comps should be recent (sold < 6 months), proximate (< 1 mile), and physically similar. Explanations are required for any deviation.

    -   **Adjustments:** Individual adjustments should not exceed 10%; net adjustments should not exceed 15%; gross adjustments should not exceed 25%. All must be well-supported.

    -   **Property Condition & Red Flags:** The property must be in average or better condition (C3 or better). Red flags include deferred maintenance, proximity to commercial/industrial areas, and any health/safety hazards. Such issues must be repaired and confirmed by a final inspection (Form 442).

    -   **Valuation:** The underwriter must reconcile the value and ensure it is supported. For LTVs > 90%, a secondary review via an automated valuation model (AVM) or desk review is required.

#### **3.2 Property Eligibility**

-   **Title Review:** A preliminary title report must be reviewed. The lender's policy must be in first lien position. All encumbrances must be acceptable.

-   **Hazard & Flood:** A Life-of-Loan Flood Zone Determination is required. If in a Special Flood Hazard Area (Zones A or V), flood insurance is mandatory.

-   **Condominiums:** A full condo project review is required. The project must be "warrantable," meeting criteria for owner-occupancy ratios (>50%), commercial space (<25%), and financial stability.

### **Part 4: Loan Structure and Ratios**

#### **4.1 Key Ratios**

-   **Loan-to-Value (LTV) / Combined LTV (CLTV):** The maximum LTV for a primary residence purchase is 95%. The maximum CLTV (including all subordinate financing) is 95%. See program-specific guidelines.

-   **Debt-to-Income (DTI):**

    -   The maximum allowable back-end DTI for a Qualified Mortgage (QM) is **43%**.

    -   **Exceptions to 45% DTI:** Ratios up to 45% require at least two of the following strong compensating factors:

        -   Credit score > 740.

        -   Post-closing reserves of at least 6 months PITI.

        -   LTV <= 80%.

        -   A significant (25%+) increase in liquid assets over the past 12 months.

#### **4.2 Program Guidelines**

Underwriters must be experts in the specific guidelines of the loan program. This manual represents the minimum standard; stricter agency/investor guidelines always apply.

### **Part 5: The Underwriting Decision**

#### **5.1 Decision and Documentation**

The underwriter's decision must be fully documented in the Loan Origination System (LOS). A detailed underwriting narrative is required for any loan with complex income, layered risk, or policy exceptions.

-   **Approval:** All documentation is present, and the loan meets all policy requirements.

-   **Suspended:** The loan requires clarification or additional documentation. A specific list of conditions must be issued.

-   **Declined:** The loan exhibits excessive risk and does not meet minimum standards.

#### **5.2 Adverse Action**

If a loan is declined, a system-generated Adverse Action Notice must be issued within 30 days of the application. The notice must be ECOA-compliant and state the specific, primary reason(s) for the denial (e.g., "Value or type of collateral not sufficient," "Income insufficient for amount of credit requested").

#### **5.3 Quality Control and Fraud**

All loans are subject to pre-funding and post-closing Quality Control audits. Underwriters are the first line of defense against fraud and must escalate any red flags, including:

-   Altered bank statements or pay stubs.

-   Undisclosed debt or liabilities.

-   Inconsistent signatures or addresses across the file.

-   Occupancy misrepresentation (e.g., claiming investment as primary).

-   Any suspected fraud must be immediately escalated to the Quality Control Manager and Chief Compliance Officer.
